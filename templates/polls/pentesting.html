A penetration test, colloquially known as a pen test or ethical hacking, is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system
  The test is performed to identify weaknesses (also referred to as vulnerabilities), including the potential for unauthorized parties to gain access to the system's features and data, as well as strengths,enabling a full risk assessment to be completed.
</p>

 <br> <b><p>The process of penetration testing may be simplified into the following five phases:</p></b>

<table class="table table-sm">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">#</th>
      <th scope="col">Phases</th>
      <th scope="col">About</th>

    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">1</th>
      <td>Reconnaissance</td>
      <td>The act of gathering important information on a target system.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">2</th>
      <td>Scanning/Information gathering</td>
      <td>Uses technical tools to further the attacker's knowledge of the system</td>

    </tr>   <tr>
      <th scope="row">3</th>
      <td>Gaining access</td>
      <td>Using the data gathered in the reconnaissance and scanning phases, the attacker can use a payload to exploit the targeted system</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">4</th>
      <td>Maintaining access</td>
      <td>Maintaining access requires taking the steps involved in being able to be persistently within the target environment in order to gather as much data as possible.</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">5</th>
      <td>Covering tracks</td>
      <td>he attacker must clear any trace of compromising the victim system, any type of data gathered, log events, in order to remain anonymous</td>
    </tr>
